# Comparing Julia and R for the fitting of Generalized Linear Mixed Models
<br>

_**TLDR:** Julia is supposed to be faster than R for pretty much everything. I tried out a couple of different optimizers and configurations for some GLMMs and Julia really isn’t that much faster than the best R options. Actually, in my context (power analyses via simulations), Julia doesn’t seem to be better than R at all._
