## Do humans have an internal model of Air Drag?

We (kinda) know that humans represent physical information about their environment, e. g. the size of objects they interact with, the gravitational pull on earth, … but is air drag among these physical properties? We think it should be. To be honest, it wouldn’t make much sense if we didn’t … but well, we’re scientists and we need to check!

I am developing this project together with [Borja Aguado](https://osf.io/tj628/) under supervision of Dr. Joan López-Moliner.

We will soon finish the pre-registration, which will be available in my OSF profile.


## Does earth-gravity conformant motion facilitate motion duration estimation?

It has been shown that earth gravity congruent motion benefitted motion duration estimates for 2D motion in front of a pictorial background. We would expect the same for more naturalistic stimuli (parabolic motion in 3D in a rich environment). And that’s what we’re testing.

I am developing this project together with Dr. Barbara LaScaleia, under supervision of Dr. Myrka Zago.
