\subsection{Research focus area}\label{research-focus-area}}

My research is focused on the role of internalized knowledge of earth
gravity in visual perception and the interaction between self-motion and
the visual perception of objects in our environment.

I have furthermore a strong interest in Philosophy of Science and I am a
defender of Open Science practices, as well as a proud member of the
LGBTQ+ community.
