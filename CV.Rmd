## Research focus area

My research is focused on the role of internalized knowledge of earth gravity in visual perception.

I have furthermore a strong interest in Philosophy of Science and I am a defender of Open Science practices, as well as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

## Conferences and Workshops

- Poster presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Earth gravity-congruent motion benefits pursuit gain for parabolic trajectories” at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society

- Poster presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Moderate Influence of Certainty about Target Size on Visual Gravity Judgements” at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society

- Oral presentation entitled “Challenges of LGBTQ+ persons in Academia” at the 1 st LGBTQ+ in STEM Day at University of Barcelona

- Poster Presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Decision Variables in Visual Gravity Judgements: Evidence from Simulating the Decision Process” at the 40th European Conference on Visual Perception ECVP 2017

- Poster presentation in Philosophy of Science entitled “Nothing New under the Sun: Problem of Induction still not Solved” at the Middle European Interdisciplinary Conference in Cognitive Science 2017

- Poster presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Temporal derivative of the elevation angle as a cue for visually perceived gravity” at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society

- Talk in Terror Management Theory entitled “Do Scientific Convictions Serve as a Buffer against Death Anxiety?” at the Workshop on Experimental Philosophy of the Berlin School of Mind and Brain
