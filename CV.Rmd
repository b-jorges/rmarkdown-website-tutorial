## Research focus area

My research is focused on the role of internalized knowledge of earth gravity in visual perception and the interaction between self-motion and the visual perception of objects in our environment.

I have furthermore a strong interest in Philosophy of Science and I am a defender of Open Science practices, as well as a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

<br>

- Poster presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Incomplete Compensation for Visual Self-Motion in the Perception of Object Velocity" presented at 
  - the 2020 Annual Meeting of the vision Science Society (VSS 2020)  
  - the LGBTQ+ STEMinar 2020 at University of Birmingham, United Kingdom

- Poster presentation in Visual Perception entitled “Earth gravity-congruent motion benefits pursuit gain for parabolic trajectories” presented at 
  - the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS 2019)
  - the LGBTQ+ STEMinar 2019 at the Institute of Physics, London, United Kingdom
