## Introduction

I recently had a discussion with some coauthors about how apt staircases procedures like the PEST, which concentrate presented stimulus intensities around the PSE and often involve few trials, are to estimate JNDs. I decided to investigate the issue using simulations. The basic idea is simple: I simulate psychophysical response data based on known PSEs and JNDs, fit psychometric functions to extract JNDs and compare the fitted JNDs to the ground-truth JNDs we put into the simulations initially.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
